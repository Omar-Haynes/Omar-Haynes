### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my account.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a compliance/asset management tool that will enable small-medium sized housing organisations to track their assets. This will track areas such as Fire, electric and Gas Safety. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Software Engineering in a bootcamp with completion scheduled for early March. Topics covered are Python, SQL, Network Protocools and Infrastructure, HTML5 and an overview of databases (outside of SQL)

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything further you would like to know.
